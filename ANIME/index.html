   <h3>meaning of japanese series anime</h3>
   <p>As a type of animation, anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums; it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself.

   <h3>origin of japanese animated series </h3> 
   <p>The origins of Japanese animation, include the first anime films and television series.
    The origins of Japanese animation can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1917. The first animated film released in Japan, and therefore the first anime, was probably released in late 1916 or very early ’17 by Shimokawa Oten. Japan began producing animation through trial-and-error drawing and cutout animation techniques, based on silent films. The oldest surviving example is Namakura Gatana (Blunt Sword) from 1917. An earlier piece of Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin (活動写真) from 1907, though it is only 3 seconds long. The first modern Japanese animation production company was founded in 1948 after WWII. The first full-length Japanese animated film was Momotaro: Umi no Shinpei, released in 1945. At the turn of the 21st century, anime began to attain wide international popularity with the Pokémon television series and films such as Miyazaki’s Spirited Away.
    
    The earliest roots of anime
    The earliest roots of anime can be traced back to traditional Japanese art forms. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, manga and other forms of visual storytelling began to gain popularity in Japan. As the popularity of these art forms grew, so did the ambition to create animation using these techniques. In 1917, trial-and-error drawing and cutout animation techniques were used to create the first animated films in Japan. These early anime films were heavily influenced by traditional art forms, employing many of their techniques to convey story elements. As anime continued to evolve, it adopted more of the stylistic and narrative elements from traditional manga and animation. Anime eventually became an audiovisual genre that is recognizable as distinct from other forms of animation. Its unique combination of graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other imaginative elements make it a powerful storytelling medium that has since become popular worldwide.
    
    The first anime films
    The pioneers of Japanese animation, Mitsuyo Seo and Tezuka Osamu, laid the foundation for the anime industry today. Seo’s first film The Sea Palace (1927) was an early example of cel-animation, while his WWII propaganda film Momotaro’s Divine Sea Warriors (1945) became the first feature-length anime ever made. Tezuka Osamu was an influential figure in the early days of anime, creating works such as Astro Boy (1963) and establishing a style that would be emulated by later filmmakers. Building on these achievements, they set the stage for future generations of animators to explore new genres and techniques. This led to a rich history of anime that continues to inspire viewers around the world.
    
    The emergence of anime on television
    The emergence of anime on television, starting with two pioneering series, Tetsuwan Atomu (Mighty Atom or Astro Boy) and Jungle Taitei, was a major milestone in the development of the genre. Both series were based on manga comics and aired in Japan in 1963. Tetsuwan Atomu was created by Osamu Tezuka and produced by Tezuka Productions, while Jungle Taitei featured the adventures of a brave lion cub. The popularity of these two shows helped to establish anime as its own genre, distinct from traditional animation. Since then, numerous other anime series have been produced for television, with Astro Boy remaining one of the most iconic examples. EVA (or Evangelion), a popular sci-fi show from 1995, is credited for rejuvenating the genre and introducing it to a new generation of viewers. The success of these early television series allowed anime to become an international phenomenon, with many titles being released worldwide.
